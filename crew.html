                <h3>Founder/Host</h3>
                <p>Casey founded the Residence Life Podcast after coming back from the 2021-2022 College winterbreak. During his leave from school, 
                    Residence Life conducted inspections of RAs' rooms. Area Director Emily Harris had saw his microphone setup and wished to learn
                     more about his podcast. Little to her knowledge Casey didn't have a podcast and just had the microphone for gaming. After seeing
                    this note made by Emily, Casey set forth to found the Residence Life Podcast. </p>
